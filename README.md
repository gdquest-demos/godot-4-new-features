# Godot 4: New Features demos

![A demo showing the new font handling: a person with a bubble that says, "hey, wake up! It's time to make video games"](static/dialogue.png)

In this project, we've built over of 20 simple demos you can play with and learn from to try some of Godot 4's new features.

Feel free to run the project and test them out!

We will keep this repository up to date with the latest Godot 4 releases.

## Bonus demos and code snippets

On top of the demos you can run from the menu, we have some examples accessible only in the editor.

- In [additional/custom_resources](additional/custom_resources), you'll find a demonstration of custom resource exports, grouped exports, auto-generation documentation, and generally, the new inspector panel and export features
- In [additional/POT_generation](additional/POT_generation), we explain how to generate POT (translation) files
- In [additional/snippets](additional/snippets), you'll find a good number of examples of the new GDScript features and syntax
- In [2d_particles](2d_particles), there's an additional rainy scene
- In [networking](networking), you'll find no less than six different network architectures, which we tried to keep as simple as possible, demonstrating different setups.

## Credits

We didn't build those demos alone; We were greatly helped by:

- Fales
- Paulloz
- Tokage
- iFire
- Smix8
- Calinou
- Raulsntos

## Controls

Most demos use:

- <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd>
- <kbd>üñ± Mouse</kbd>
- <kbd>Left Mouse</kbd>
- <kbd>‚ê£ Space</kbd>

Where relevant, we've described the controls.
